IB Final Project Outline

• Problem
	• The learning environment has drastically changed and has often become disorganized especially for time mgmt and prioritization. This presents a difficult challenge for parents during these times.
•  These ever-changing times have exacerbated the underlying problems of the ability to balance schoolwork, family responsibilities, social events, etc.“Tasky” has an opportunity to create a service which bridges the gap of our new virtual environment and effective and meaningful learning.

• Persona
• Target Audience: 
Parents having children with an age group with the age of 8 years and above
	• Pain points
Disorganization
Balancing Parent’s responsibilities with obligations towards children
Parents essentially becoming teachers in addition to their existing responsibilities
Children: 
	• Pain points
Accountability - Distractions (social media & gaming)
Adjusting to remote learning
Lack of structure inducing unnecessary stress and anxiety within their learning environment

• Solutions (How we solve the pain points of these parents)
• Parents being able to track Kids schedules via API integrations
• Set mandatory tasks and track the progress of their children
	• Workflow (We will make design initially alongside the pseudologic needed to develop the feature and adjust accordingly once we define the details via our research)
		• Technical (Logic and API Research)
		• Design
• When parents sign up and create an account; we give them a quiz and the app/service would adjust the features based on their preferences (e.g. number of children)
	• Workflow
		• Technical
			- DOM functionality with buttons assigning variables to the survey HTMLS
